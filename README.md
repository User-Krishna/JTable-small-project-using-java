<h1>Login Form Application in Java üñ•Ô∏è</h1>
This Login Form is a simple application created using Java Swing that allows users to enter their username and password into a graphical user interface (GUI). The form has a Login button that, when clicked, prints the entered credentials (username and password) to the console.

The application demonstrates basic Java GUI components such as JTextField for username input, JPasswordField for password input, and JButton for triggering actions. It uses absolute positioning for component layout with the setLayout(null) method.

<h1>Key Features üåü</h1>
<h3>Username & Password Fields:</h3> Users can input their username and password securely using text and password fields.
<h3>Login Button: </h3>h3>Once clicked, the Login button triggers the actionPerformed() method and displays the entered data in the console.
<h3>User-friendly Design:</h3> The app uses a hand cursor on the Login button to indicate interactivity, enhancing the user experience.
<h3>Basic Input Handling:</h3> Simple action handling with Java ActionListener interface for button click events.
  
<h1>How the Application Works ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>
<h3>User Input: </h3>The user enters a username and password in the respective fields.
<h3>Login Action: </h3>Clicking the Login button prints the entered data to the console using the actionPerformed() method.
<h3>GUI Elements: </h3>The app uses JLabels, JTextFields, JPasswordField, and JButton to create a user-friendly form layout.

<h1>Example Usage üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
<h3>Run the Application:</h3> Open the project in a Java IDE, run the Login_Form class.
